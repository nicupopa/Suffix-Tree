## Project Overview

This project implements a **Suffix Tree** using the **Racket** programming language. A suffix tree is a powerful data structure used primarily for efficient string matching, pattern searching, and text compression tasks. The project is split into multiple stages, each building on top of the other to refine and complete the suffix tree functionality.

## Features

- **Suffix Tree Construction**: Efficiently builds a tree structure that stores all the suffixes of a string.
- **Pattern Matching**: Provides fast searching for substrings and patterns within the input string.
- **Optimized Traversal**: Enables quick lookups and pattern matching without scanning the entire string.

## How to Run

1. **Run the Stages**:  
   - You can load each stage file (`etapa1.rkt`, `etapa2.rkt`, `etapa3.rkt`) individually.
   
2. **Run the Full Suffix Tree**:  
   - Once you've loaded `suffix-tree.rkt`, you can test the full functionality of the suffix tree (insertion, search, etc.).
